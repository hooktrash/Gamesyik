   <hr />
   <p class="game">As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there was no official release or information available about a game titled "Watch Dogs 5.<br />
      " The "Watch Dogs" series is known for its open-world, hacking-themed gameplay developed by Ubisoft. <br />
      Up to that point, the series had released "Watch Dogs" (2014), "Watch Dogs 2" (2016), and "Watch Dogs: Legion" (2020).<br />
      It's possible that a new installment may have been released or announced since then, so I recommend checking the latest gaming news and Ubisoft's official channels for updates on any future releases in the "Watch Dogs" series.<br />
